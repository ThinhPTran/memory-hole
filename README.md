## Running during development

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run migrate
    lein run

To compile ClojureScript front-end, run:
    
    lein figwheel

## Building for production

    lein uberjar
    
This will produce `target/uberjar/memory-hole.jar` archive that can be run as follows:
   
    java -Dconf=conf.edn -jar memory-hole.jar migrate
    java -Dconf=conf.edn -jar memory-hole.jar

The `conf.edn` file should contain the configuration such as the database URL that will be used in production.
