>When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building

Memory Hole is a support issue organizer. It's designed to provide a way to organize and search common support issues and their resolution.

### [screenshots](https://github.com/yogthos/memory-hole/tree/master/screenshots)

## Features

- The app uses LDAP and/or internal table to handle authentication
- Issues are ranked based on the number of views and last time of access
- File attachments for issues
- Issues are organized by user generated tags
- Markdown with live preview for issues
- Weighted full text search using PostgreSQL citext extension

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed to compile the application.
You will also need an instance of [PostgreSQL][2] database configured. See [here](#configuring-postgresql) for
details.

## Running during development

Create a `profiles.clj` file in the project directory with the configuration settings for the database and optionally LDAP, e.g:

```clojure
{:profiles/dev
 {:env
  {:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres?user=admin&password=admin"
  ;;optional, will use internal table otherwise
  :ldap
  {:host
     {:address         "my-ldap-server.ca"
      :port            389
      :connect-timeout (* 1000 5)
      :timeout         (* 1000 30)}}}}}
```

Run the migrations

    lein run migrate

This will create the tables and add a default admin user, The default login is: `admin/admin`.

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

To compile ClojureScript front-end, run:

    lein figwheel

## Building for production

    lein uberjar

This will produce `target/uberjar/memory-hole.jar` archive that can be run as follows:

    java -Dconf=conf.edn -jar memory-hole.jar migrate
    java -Dconf=conf.edn -jar memory-hole.jar

The `conf.edn` file should contain the configuration such as the database URL that will be used in production, e.g:

```clojure
{:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres?user=admin&password=admin"}
```

### Security

To enable HTTPS support in production add the the following configuration under the `:ssl` key:

```clojure
{:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres?user=admin&password=admin"
 :ssl
 {:port 3001
  :keystore "keystore.jks"
  :keystore-pass "changeit"}}
```

To disable HTTP access, set the `:port` to `nil`:

```clojure
{:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres?user=admin&password=admin"
 :port nil
 :ssl
 {:port 3001
  :keystore "keystore.jks"
  :keystore-pass "changeit"}}
```

Alternatively, you can front the app with Nginx in production.
See [here](http://www.luminusweb.net/docs/deployment.md#setting_up_ssl) for details on configuring Nginx.


## Configuring PostgreSQL

Follow these steps to configure the database for the application

1. Run the `psql` command:

        psql -U <superuser|postgres user> -d postgres -h localhost

2. Create the role role for accessing the database:

        CREATE ROLE memoryhole;

3. Set the password for the role:

        \password memoryhole;

4. Optionally, create a schema and grant the `memoryhole` role authorization:

        CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION memoryhole;
        GRANT ALL ON SHCEMA memoryhole TO memoryhole;
        GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA memoryhole TO memoryhole;

5. Exit the shell

        \q
